Denial of service attacks can be performed by the aggressive injection of dummy messages over a network or by halting access to shared network devices. e.g. flooding, jamming, synch \cite{biswas2012ddos}\\



Black hole -  A black hole is formed by nodes which fail to propagate messages \cite{laurendeau2006threats} \\


Hidden vehicle - the hidden vehicle attack consists in deceiving vehicle A into believing that the attacker is better placed for forwarding the warning message, thus leading to silencing A and making it hidden, in DSRC terms, to other vehicles \cite{raya2007securing}\\
