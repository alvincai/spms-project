ATTACKS ON IEEE 802.11P
Supervisor: Michael Feiri (K)
============
This assignment consists of two parts: First you will evaluate a set of patches for
the Atheros ath5k chipset to enable operation with a set of reference 802.11p
devices. Second, you will write attack tools for the aforementioned 11p setup or for
the reference 11p units. These attack tools should perform simple Denial-of-Service
attacks and basic fuzzing. Bonus points for updating/writing plugins for wireshark
to support the latest editions of ETSI ITS standards.
