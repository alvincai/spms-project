For a packets in packets attack \cite{goodspeed2011packets}, an attacker injects specially crafted packets into the network that appear to be valid. However, upon radio interference, the outer packet is damaged and the receiver is tricked into accepting the inner packet that contains a malicious payload. This attack is perhaps extra plausible in a VANET scenario because we have trusted hardware and firmware components but maybe untrusted applications e.g. infotainment system?\\
